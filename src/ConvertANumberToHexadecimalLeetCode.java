/**

 *
 * Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is
 * used.
 *
 * Note:
 * All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
 * The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero
 * character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
 * The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 26
 * Output:
 * "1a"
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * -1
 * Output:
 * "ffffffff"
