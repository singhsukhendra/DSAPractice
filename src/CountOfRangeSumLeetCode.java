/**
 * Created by S N Rao on 2/23/2017.
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
 * Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
 *
 * Note:
 * A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
 * Return 3.
 * The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.

    //This is officially the most complicated problem encountered on leetcode till date (2/23/2017).
    //Although the premise is pretty simple (just counting inversion merge sort type logic), the intricacies of the
    //whole thing are immense. Very challenging and demanded a lot of concentration.

    //The logic is that first sum the array, and send the sum array to merge sort function. That function computes the
    //answer in two halves of the array and sorts it based on the sums as well in the process. The whole genius of the
    //algorithm lies in the count step before the merge step.

    //During the count and merge stage, we have already sorted the left half [start, mid) and right half [mid, end). We then iterate
    //through the left half with index i. For each i, we need to find two indices j and k in the right half where

    //j is the first index satisfy sums[j] - sums[i] >= lower.
    //k is the first index satisfy sums[k] - sums[i] > upper.

    //Then the number of sums in [lower, upper] is k-j. We increase the answer variable by this value.

    //Despite the nested loops (having to find j and k for each i), the time complexity of the "count & merge" stage is
    //still linear. Because the indices k, j, will only increase but not decrease, each of them will only traverse the
    //right half once at most. The total time complexity of this divide and conquer solution is then O(n log n).
